**********************************************************************************************************************************
Multy threading app with the concurrent collections
**********************************************************************************************************************************

				Ideas for the app
DONE			1. Console app 
DONE			2. Make it a props stock app 
					Pokeballs
					Poke incubators
					Swords
					PolygonCharmander
					PolygonSquirtle
					PolygonBulbasaur
				
DONE			3. Make an example using the normal dictionary 
				4. Make an example using the ConcurrentDictionary
IN PROGRESS		4. Take time between each run to see how each type behaves
DONE			5. Make multiple methods to see how each one behaves on the thread
					Loop add
					Loop subtract
					Loop Multiply
					Loop Divide
					Loop add and subtract
					Loop add and multiply 
IN PROGRESS		6. To all methods add a sleep that way they will take longer and I can see how each type behaves
				7. Check between reads to see if I get locks on threads 
				8. Once all the processes are done show the final result
				
				
				**********************************************************************************************************************************
				Flow of application
				This describes in a simple matter what the application does in the same order as it's intended
				**********************************************************************************************************************************
				
				Test 1: Normal dictionary
DONE			1. Set up a normal dictionary
DONE			2. Run the methods that I decided on above for each of the items in the dictionary 
DONE			3. Present the final information
DONE			4. Present the amount of time it took to process all the information without using threading 
				Notes: 
				-Since I don't get to code a lot of them I want to practice it a bit. Help it stay on my head better. 
				-Also since this part is the one that won't require threading this will be my benchmark to beat when running the other processes
				
				Test 2: Using the task and wait all method from the threading library to run the same processes
DONE			1. Set up normal dictionary
DONE			2. Add the same methods to an individual task 
DONE			3. Use the wait all 
DONE			4. Present the amount of time it took to process all the information 
				
				Test 3: Use the concurrent dictionary
DONE			1. Create a concurrent dictionary
DONE			2. Add values to the dictionary
DONE			3. Run multiple tasks with data from the concurrent dictionary that also processes the values and updates the dictionary
DONE			4. Present the amount of time it took to process all the information 
				5. Also added one last test to show data while data is running successfully without locking the dictionary
				
				Test 4: See if I can set up the concurrent bag and check if I can make it work around the same logic 
				1. Set up normal dictionary
				2. Add the same methods to an individual task 
				3. Use the wait all 
				4. Present the amount of time it took to process all the information 
				
				Test 5: Locking the thread
				1. Set up a count of the dictionary to force a thread lock and see how the app behaves in this case
